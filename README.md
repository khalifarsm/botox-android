## ðŸ”’ Security Features
To enhance security, we have replaced Firebase FCM with secure WebSocket communication, implemented a wipe token system, ensured that remote wipe commands are decryptable only by the application, added advanced in-app logging for remote commands, and enforced user confirmation before any wipe action can be executed.

| Feature | Status |
|--------|--------|
| **Implement a wipe token**: Each user should generate a local-only encrypted token during setup, used to validate remote wipe requests. This token is never stored on your server. | âœ… Complete |
| **Strip debug metadata before production** (`minifyEnabled true` and remove `DebugProbesKt.bin`). | âœ… Complete |
| **Make remote wipe command decryptable only by the app (client-side).** | âœ… Complete |
| **Show clear user onboarding before enabling Device Admin, explaining its impact.** | âœ… Complete |
| **Disable Firebase Analytics and tracking features in production.** <br> _Replaced with secure WebSocket._ | âœ… Complete |
| **Provide an activity log within the app to show received remote commands.** | âœ… Complete |
| **Use self-hosted FCM alternatives (like ntfy.sh) or open-source push systems if needed.** <br> _Replaced with secure WebSocket._ | âœ… Complete |
| **Ensure app cannot silently wipe without visible confirmation unless explicitly set by user.** | âœ… Complete |
